# Lateral Rapid Diagnostic Machine (L.R.D.M.)

## Overview
The Lateral Rapid Diagnostic Machine (L.R.D.M.) is a portable, AI-enabled diagnostic system designed to automate and enhance lateral flow assay (LFA) testing for rapid disease detection.

This project integrates machine learning, embedded systems, and hardware design to create a low-cost, real-time diagnostic device capable of analyzing test strips and producing accurate results without manual interpretation.

---

## Motivation
Rapid diagnostic tests are widely used for detecting infectious diseases due to their affordability and ease of use. However, traditional test interpretation is manual, subjective, and prone to error.

L.R.D.M. addresses these limitations by:
- Automating result interpretation using computer vision
- Reducing human error in diagnosis
- Enabling consistent and repeatable results
- Providing a low-cost alternative to expensive commercial systems

---

## System Architecture
The system combines hardware and machine learning components:

### Hardware
- Imaging system for capturing LFA strip results
- Sensors and PCB integration for device control
- Portable enclosure designed using CAD

### Software / AI
- Image preprocessing pipeline
- CNN-based classification model for test result detection
- Real-time inference for rapid diagnostics
